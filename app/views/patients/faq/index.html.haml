              Eptex Acne Wash is a benzoyl peroxide wash that cleans your skin and
              provides benzoyl peroxide in a form that penetrates into the follicle and helps
              stop bacteria from growing and causing acne. It’s different from other benzoyl
              peroxide acne washes because it targets the source of acne-causing bacteria
              with a unique sub-micron encapsulation system, enabling 4.5% benzoyl
              peroxide to be delivered deep into the follicle where bacteria reside.

              It works through exfoliation, which is the removal of the dead skin cells from
              the epidermis, the top layer of the skin. Exfoliation deeply cleanses the skin,
              dislodging buildup in the pores and helping to break up whiteheads. It also
              helps to smooth and refine the skin’s texture. Eptex Controlled Release Acne
              Relief Lotion contains essential lipids that help keep your skin’s natural barrier
              healthy, while its patented delivery system slowly releases these ingredients
              over time, making it appropriate even for sensitive skin.

              Wash with a unique 4.5% benzoyl peroxide -- -Eptex Acne Wash should be
              used to cleanse the skin and allow the Benzoyl Peroxide to get into pores. 
              How does it do this? The Intelli-Target Technology makes the benzoyl
              peroxide, which is normally a very large molecule that can only sit on top of the
              skin, very small, around 0.1 to 1.0 microns. Therefore, it can readily enter the
              follicle where it can eradicate the acne-causing bacteria at the source.
              %br
              Exfoliate with controlled-release salicylic acid-- - use Eptex Acne Relief Lotion
              to gently exfoliate your skin unblocking the pores while keeping it well hydrated and at a safe pH.
              Eptex Acne Relief Lotion also contains ingredients that effectively keep the skin moisturized, minimizing the most frequent complaint
              with salicylic acid products.
